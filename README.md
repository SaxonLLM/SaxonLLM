# SaxonLLM

SaxonLLM is an experimental language model focused on understanding and generating text in the Sächsisch dialect. This project aims to explore the potential of natural language models for less widely spoken dialects. While the model is still in its early stages, it provides basic functionality like text generation and translation.

## Demo

You can try out the model's capabilities in the demo below. It is only a representative sample of models output for a selected few prompts. The prompts are related to the task specified in the project objectives:

- **Story Task**: Write a short story about two Saxons in the Deutsche Bahn.
- **Translation Task**: Translate the given text into Sächsisch.
- **History Task**: What is the history of TU Dresden?
- **Saying Hello**: How do you say 'Good Morning' in Sächsisch?
